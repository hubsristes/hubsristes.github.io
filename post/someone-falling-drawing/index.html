-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=forum-draw-a-person-falling--deviantart>Forum: Draw A Person Falling&mldr; | DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#forum-draw-a-person-falling--deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://fc08.deviantart.net/fs70/z/2012/087/7850072_1671715.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.RwVB1W3bPmAICNAq7WuvAAHaFm&pid=15.1"' alt="Forum: draw a person falling... | DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: forum.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Who should use cool wallpaper?
